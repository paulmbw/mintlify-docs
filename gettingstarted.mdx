There are two ways to get started with Launchtoday:

## Option 1: Fork the Repository (Recommended)

This approach allows you to create multiple apps and easily manage updates:

1. Fork the repository by visiting [github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli) and clicking "Fork"
2. Clone your forked repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/launchtoday-rncli.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```

## Option 2: Direct Clone

If you just want to create a single app, you can clone directly:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```

## Setting Up Your Project

Once you have cloned the repository using either method, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
cp .env.example .env
yarn
```

## Platform-Specific Setup

### iOS Setup

1. Install CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
npx pod-install
```

2. Open the iOS project in Xcode:

```bash
open ios/LaunchToday.xcworkspace
```

3. Update your Bundle Identifier:

   - In Xcode, select the "Launchtoday" project in the navigator on the left
   - Select the "Launchtoday" target
   - Under the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, change the Bundle Identifier from "com.launchtoday" to your chosen identifier (e.g., "com.yourcompany.appname")

4. Configure your Development Team:

   - In the same "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Select your Development Team from the dropdown
   - If you don't have one, sign in with your Apple ID in Xcode preferences

### Android Setup

Android setup is typically ready to go after the initial project setup. Just ensure you have:

- Android Studio installed
- An Android emulator set up or a physical device connected

## Running Your App

You can start the app using **npx expo run** and choose your platform, or use these commands:

```bash
yarn ios:simulator
# or
yarn run android
```

<Info>
  `ios:simulator` is a shortcut for running the app on a specific iOS simulator,
  specifically targeting the iPhone 15 Pro Max. If you're having trouble
  targeting a specific iOS simulator, check out our [FAQ guide on targeting iOS
  simulators](/faqs#how-do-i-target-a-specific-ios-simulator).
