There are two ways to get started with LaunchToday CLI:

## Option 1: Fork the Repository (Recommended)

This approach allows you to create multiple apps and easily manage updates:

1. Fork the repository by visiting [github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli) and clicking "Fork"
2. Clone your forked repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/launchtoday-rncli.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```

## Option 2: Direct Clone

If you just want to create a single app, you can clone directly:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```

## Setting Up Your Project

Once you have cloned the repository using either method, run the following commands:

```bash
cd [YOUR_APP_NAME]
yarn
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running Your App

You can start the app using **npx expo run** and choose your platform, or use these commands:

```bash
yarn run ios
# or
yarn run android
```
