Sign in with Apple provides iOS users with a secure and familiar authentication experience. Launchtoday comes with this capability pre-configured in the application, making the setup process straightforward. The integration handles the complete authentication flow from initial sign-in to session management in your Supabase backend.

## Verifying Pre-configured Capabilities

Your Launchtoday application already includes Sign in with Apple capability. You can verify this in Xcode:

1. Open your iOS project in Xcode
2. Select the "Launchtoday" project in the navigator
3. Choose the "Launchtoday" target
4. Navigate to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab
5. You should see "Sign in with Apple" listed among the capabilities

You can also verify this in the `Launchtoday.entitlements` file [here](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/474f79360cec689484f00906a341eddcc5c0a25e/ios/Launchtoday/Launchtoday.entitlements#L5).

This pre-configuration saves you time by handling the initial setup requirements.

## Supabase Configuration

To enable Sign in with Apple in your application:

1. In your Supabase Dashboard, go to Authentication > Providers
2. Enable the Apple provider
3. Set the Service ID to match your bundle identifier (e.g., "com.yourcompany.appname")

With these configurations in place, Sign in with Apple will be fully functional in your application. The integration manages user sessions, profile creation, and secure token handling automatically through Supabase.

Once configured, you can test the Sign in with Apple flow by running the application with `yarn ios:simulator` or via Xcode.

## Testing the Integration

Once configured, you can test the Sign in with Apple flow by running your application with `yarn ios:simulator`. The authentication process will present users with Apple's secure sign-in interface, where they can authenticate using their Apple ID and choose whether to share or hide their email address.

Remember to test both the success and failure scenarios to ensure your application handles all cases gracefully. The integration automatically manages token refresh and session persistence, providing a seamless authentication experience for your iOS users.
