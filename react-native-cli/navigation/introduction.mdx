Launchtoday uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) to provide a robust and flexible navigation system for your mobile app. This guide will help you understand how navigation is structured and implemented in the app.

## Navigation Structure Overview

The app's navigation follows a hierarchical structure with three main components:

1. **Root Navigator**: The top-level navigator that manages the app's navigation state and determines whether to show authentication flows or main content.

2. **Auth Navigator**: Handles all authentication-related screens using stack navigation.

3. **Home Navigator**: Manages the main app content using drawer navigation with nested stack navigators for specific features.

## Navigation Patterns Used

### Stack Navigation

Stack navigation is used for linear flows where screens are placed on top of each other, like a deck of cards. In Launchtoday, it's primarily used for:

- Authentication flows
- Step-by-step processes
- Feature-specific flows (like payments)

Key characteristics:

- Screens transition from right to left (iOS) or slide up/fade (Android)
- Automatic back button navigation
- Maintained navigation history

### Drawer Navigation

Drawer navigation provides a side menu for main app navigation. It's used in the authenticated portion of the app and offers:

- Side menu that slides from the left
- Access to main app features
- Persistent availability throughout the app
- Toggle via hamburger menu icon

## Implementation Details

### 1. Root Navigator

The root navigator serves as the foundation of the navigation system:

- Controls the main navigation flow
- Handles authentication state switching
- Routes to either AuthNavigator or HomeNavigator

You can find the implementation of the Root Navigator [here](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/main/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx).

### 2. Auth Navigator

Manages the authentication flow with these screens:

- Login Screen
- Email Input Screen
- Magic Link Sent Screen

You can find the implementation of the Auth Navigator [here](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/main/src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx).

### 3. Home Navigator

Implements the main app navigation with:

- Dashboard Screen
- Payments Navigator (nested stack)
  - Payments Screen
  - Stripe Screen
  - RevenueCat Screen
- Profile Screen
- Feedback Screen

You can find the implementation of the Home Navigator [here](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/main/src/navigation/HomeNavigator.tsx).

This structure ensures a clear separation between authenticated and unauthenticated states while maintaining a smooth user experience through well-organized navigation patterns.
