[Supabase](https://supabase.com) serves as the backbone of Launchtoday's backend infrastructure. As an open-source alternative to Firebase, it provides a complete suite of backend services through a unified API. These services include a PostgreSQL database for data management, authentication systems for user access, real-time subscriptions for live updates and storage capabilities for media handling.

## Understanding Supabase Integration

In our application architecture, Supabase manages several essential features. The authentication system supports multiple sign-in methods including Apple authentication, Google authentication and passwordless email authentication through Magic Links. Our PostgreSQL database handles all user-related data storage needs from basic profile information to user-submitted feedback. The platform's S3-compatible storage system takes care of profile images and other media assets your application might need.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Setting up Supabase involves two main steps: creating your project space and connecting it to your application. Let's walk through this process.

### Creating Your Supabase Project

Begin by creating your project environment. Head to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and sign in to your account. From your dashboard, locate and click the "New Project" button. You'll need to provide some basic information:

- Select or create an organization for your project
- Choose a name for your project
- Set a database password
- Select a region closest to your users

After entering these details, click "Create new project." Supabase will handle the initialization process and set up your database, API and authentication systems.

### Configuring API Credentials

Once your project initializes, you'll need to set up your API credentials:

1. Navigate to your project settings through the dashboard at `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<your-project-id>/settings/api`
2. Look for your project URL and anon/public key
3. Add these details to your application's environment:

    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

Open your `.env` file and add the following variables:

```env
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL="https://example.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
```

With your basic Supabase configuration in place, you're ready to implement specific authentication methods. We'll start with setting up Sign in with Apple in the next section.
