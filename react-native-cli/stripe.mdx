Stripe integration enables secure payment processing in Launchtoday. The app comes with Stripe pre-configured, providing a robust payment infrastructure that supports one-time payments, subscriptions, and digital wallet payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the setup, ensure you have:

1. A Stripe account
   - Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
   - Complete the basic account verification
2. API Keys from your Stripe Dashboard
   - Navigate to Developers > API Keys
   - You'll need both Publishable and Secret keys

<Note>
  Keep your Secret Key private and never expose it in your client-side code. The
  Secret Key should only be used in your backend services.
</Note>

## Setup Process

### 1. Environment Configuration

Launchtoday already includes the Stripe integration code. To activate it, you only need to add your Stripe credentials to your environment variables:

```bash:.env
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key
STRIPE_MERCHANT_IDENTIFIER=merchant.com.yourapp # Required for Apple Pay
```

### 2. Stripe Provider

The Stripe provider is already implemented in Launchtoday ([view in Github](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/main/src/providers/stripe.tsx)). The provider:

- Automatically reads Stripe credentials from your environment variables
- Provides warning messages if credentials are missing
- Exports `initPaymentSheet` and `presentPaymentSheet` utilities for payment processing
- Wraps Launchtoday with Stripe's context provider

The provider is already integrated into Launchtoday's root component [here](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/main/App.tsx), so no additional setup is required.

Once you've added your Stripe credentials to your environment variables, you're ready to start processing payments. Here is what the payment sheet from Stripe looks like on iOS and Android:

**iOS:**
<img
  src="/images/stripe-ios.png"
  alt="Stripe iOS"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

**Android:**
<img
  src="/images/stripe-android.png"
  alt="Stripe Android"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

### 3. Digital Wallet Setup

#### Apple Pay Configuration

1. Register for an Apple Merchant ID in your [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Add the merchant identifier to your environment variables
3. In your Stripe Dashboard:
   - Navigate to Settings > Payment Methods
   - Enable Apple Pay
   - Complete domain verification if needed

#### Google Pay Configuration

1. In your Stripe Dashboard:
   - Navigate to Settings > Payment Methods
   - Enable Google Pay
2. No additional code changes required - the integration is already handled

## Using the Integration

### Payment Sheet Implementation

The Payment Sheet component is pre-configured in your application. To process a payment:

```typescript
import { useStripe } from "@/hooks/useStripe";

const PaymentScreen = () => {
  const { initPayment } = useStripe();

  const handlePayment = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await initPayment({
        amount: 1000, // Amount in cents
        currency: "usd",
        description: "Product purchase",
      });

      if (result.success) {
        // Handle successful payment
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle payment error
    }
  };
};
```

## Testing

Stripe provides a set of test card numbers for development:

| Card Number         | Scenario           |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Successful payment |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Failed payment     |

Use any future date for expiry, any 3 digits for CVC, and any postal code.

## Monitoring & Debugging

1. View payment activity in your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)
2. Monitor logs in Development mode:
   ```typescript
   // Logs are automatically enabled in development
   if (__DEV__) {
     console.log("Stripe payment result:", result);
   }
   ```
3. Use Stripe's test webhook events to simulate various payment scenarios

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**

```typescript
try {
  const { error } = await initPaymentSheet({
    // payment details
  });

  if (error) {
    // Handle specific error cases
    switch (error.code) {
      case "card_declined":
        // Handle declined card
        break;
      default:
      // Handle other errors
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Handle unexpected errors
}
```

2. **Payment Confirmation**

```typescript
// Always verify payment status on your backend
const verifyPayment = async (paymentIntentId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/verify-payment", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ paymentIntentId }),
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

## Going Live

Before moving to production:

1. Complete Stripe's verification process
2. Update environment variables to use live keys
3. Test thoroughly with real cards
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Update your privacy policy and terms of service

<Note>
  Always test your payment integration thoroughly in development mode before
  switching to live mode. Never use test API keys in production.
