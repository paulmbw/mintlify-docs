App Store Connect is Apple's platform for managing your iOS apps, including app submission, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. It serves as the central hub where developers configure their app's monetization strategy, manage app versions, and handle the app review process. For RevenueCat integration, we'll specifically focus on using App Store Connect to set up your in-app purchases and subscriptions.

<Note>
  App Store Connect is only accessible to registered Apple Developer Program members. Make sure you have an active membership ($99/year) before proceeding.
