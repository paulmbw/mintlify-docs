The Google Play Console is Google's platform for managing Android apps, including app publishing, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. It serves as the central hub where developers configure their app's monetization strategy, manage app versions, and handle the app review process. For RevenueCat integration, we'll specifically focus on using the Google Play Console to set up your in-app purchases and subscriptions.

<Note>
  Google Play Console is only accessible to registered Google Play Developer
  accounts. Make sure you have an active account ($25 one-time fee) before
  proceeding.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee)
- Your app created in the Google Play Console
- Completed the app setup in the Google Play Console
- Accepted the Play Console developer agreement

## In-App Products Setup

### Creating In-App Products

Navigate to the Play Console and select your app. In the left sidebar, find "Monetize" and then "Products". Click the "In-app products" button and then click the "Create product" button to begin setting up a new in-app purchase:

<img
  src="/images/google-play/in-app-1.png"
  alt="In-app products"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

<img
  src="/images/google-play/in-app-2.png"
  alt="In-app products"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

When creating the product, you'll need to configure the following:

1. **Product ID**: Choose a unique identifier for your product. Following best practices, include the price in the ID (e.g., "premium_upgrade_499" for a $4.99 purchase)

2. **Product Details**: Configure the following:

   - Product name: A clear, user-facing title that describes your product
   - Product description: Detailed explanation of what users get with their purchase

3. **Pricing**: Configure the following:

   - Base price: Set your default price in your primary currency. Depending on your pricing strategy, you may want to check the "Allow users to purchase more than 1 of this product in a single transaction" option.

4. **Tax compliance programs**: Configure tax settings and compliance requirements

Once you've completed the configuration, click the "Create" button to save your product. Then, click "activate" to activate the in-app product.

Below are the key sections you'll need to complete:

1. **Basic Details**:

   - Product ID (e.g., "coins_pack_999")
   - Product name (displayed to users)
   - Description of the product
   - Status (active/inactive)

2. **Pricing**:

   - Set your base price
   - Configure regional pricing
   - Optional: Set up pricing templates

3. **Availability**:
   - Choose which countries can access the product
   - Set publication status

## Subscription Setup

### Creating Subscription Products

To set up subscriptions, navigate to "Monetize" > "Subscriptions" in the Play Console. Click "Create subscription" to begin. You will be promoted to provide a Product ID (e.g. sub_monthly_9_99) and Name (e.g Monthly Subscription ($9.99)) for your subscription:

<img
  src="/images/google-play/in-app-3.jpg"
  alt="In-app products"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

<img
  src="/images/google-play/in-app-4.jpg"
  alt="In-app products"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

Once you've created the subscription, you'll be prompted to configure the following:

1. **Set up the subscription**: To make a subscription available for purchase, describe its benefits, then create base plans and their offers

2. **Base plans and offers**:

   - **Base Plan ID**: A unique identifier for the base plan
   - **Type**: Auto-renewing, prepaid or installments
   - **Price and availability**: Configure regional pricing

Depending on your pricing strategy, you will need to consider which subscription type you want to create for your app, either monthly, yearly or whichever cadence makes sense for your app. Once you
have created your subscriptions, the dashoard should look like the following:

<img
  src="/images/google-play/in-app-6.jpg"
  alt="In-app products"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

## Testing Configuration

When working with in-app purchases and subscriptions on Android, it's important to understand that testing can only be done on physical devices - emulators will not work. Additionally, Google Play requires that you create and publish your app to a closed testing track before any purchase testing can occur. According to RevenueCat's documentation, this is a mandatory requirement that cannot be bypassed.

To properly test your in-app purchases and subscriptions, follow these steps to set up a closed testing track:

1. Navigate to Testing > Closed testing in the Play Console
2. Create a new closed testing release and upload your app bundle/APK
3. Add the Gmail addresses of your testers
4. Complete the testing track setup and submit for review
5. Wait for Google Play's approval (typically takes a few hours)

Once your closed testing track is approved, you can begin testing purchases on physical devices. The Play Console offers several comprehensive testing methods to ensure your purchase flows work correctly:

### License Testing
- Access Setup > License Testing in the console
- Add Gmail accounts that will be used for testing
- Enable license testing responses to prevent actual charges
- Test purchases will be processed without real payments

### Internal Testing Track
You can create an internal testing release for a more controlled testing environment:
- Set up an internal testing release
- Add specific test users
- Have testers install the app from this track
- Verify the complete purchase flow works as expected

### Purchase Flow Validation
Make sure to thoroughly test:
- Complete purchase flows using test accounts
- Various purchase states and transitions
- Full subscription lifecycle including renewals
- Proper receipt handling and validation

### Best Practices for Implementation

When implementing your purchase system, keep these key points in mind:

**Product ID Management**
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Include pricing information in identifiers (e.g., monthly_sub_999)
- Keep IDs descriptive and easily identifiable

**Testing Protocol**
- Test all possible purchase scenarios
- Verify cancellation and refund handling
- Ensure subscription renewals work correctly
- Test restore purchases functionality

**Documentation Requirements**
- Maintain detailed records of all product IDs
- Document your testing procedures
- Keep track of pricing changes and history

### Moving Forward

After you've completed the Play Console configuration and testing, your next steps should be:

1. [RevenueCat Dashboard Setup](/react-native-cli/revenueCat-android)
2. [Android Implementation Guide](/react-native-cli/revenueCat-android)

Remember to keep your product IDs readily available as you'll need them when configuring your products in RevenueCat's dashboard.
