The Google Play Console is Google's platform for managing Android apps, including app publishing, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. It serves as the central hub where developers configure their app's monetization strategy, manage app versions, and handle the app review process. For RevenueCat integration, we'll specifically focus on using the Google Play Console to set up your in-app purchases and subscriptions.

<Note>
  Google Play Console is only accessible to registered Google Play Developer
  accounts. Make sure you have an active account ($25 one-time fee) before
  proceeding.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee)
- Your app created in the Google Play Console
- Completed the app setup in the Google Play Console
- Accepted the Play Console developer agreement

## In-App Products Setup

### Creating In-App Products

Navigate to the Play Console and select your app. In the left sidebar, find "Monetize" and then "Products". Click the "In-app products" button and then click the "Create product" button to begin setting up a new in-app purchase:

<img
  src="/images/google-play/in-app-1.png"
  alt="In-app products"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

<img
  src="/images/google-play/in-app-2.png"
  alt="In-app products"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

When creating the product, you'll need to configure the following:

1. **Product ID**: Choose a unique identifier for your product. Following best practices, include the price in the ID (e.g., "premium_upgrade_499" for a $4.99 purchase)

2. **Product Details**: Configure the following:

   - Product name: A clear, user-facing title that describes your product
   - Product description: Detailed explanation of what users get with their purchase

3. **Pricing**: Configure the following:

   - Base price: Set your default price in your primary currency. Depending on your pricing strategy, you may want to check the "Allow users to purchase more than 1 of this product in a single transaction" option.

4. **Tax compliance programs**: Configure tax settings and compliance requirements

Once you've completed the configuration, click the "Create" button to save your product. Then, click "activate" to activate the in-app product.

Below are the key sections you'll need to complete:

1. **Basic Details**:

   - Product ID (e.g., "coins_pack_999")
   - Product name (displayed to users)
   - Description of the product
   - Status (active/inactive)

2. **Pricing**:

   - Set your base price
   - Configure regional pricing
   - Optional: Set up pricing templates

3. **Availability**:
   - Choose which countries can access the product
   - Set publication status

## Subscription Setup

### Creating Subscription Products

To set up subscriptions, navigate to "Monetization setup" > "Subscriptions" in the Play Console. Click "Create subscription" to begin. The subscription setup process is more detailed than one-time products and includes several important components:

1. **Base Plan Configuration**:

   - Product ID (e.g., "sub_monthly_999")
   - Name and description
   - Billing period (monthly, annual, etc.)
   - Price and regional pricing
   - Free trial options
   - Grace period settings

2. **Subscription Features**:

   - **Base Plans**: Configure different subscription durations
   - **Offers**: Set up promotional pricing
   - **Multi-line Subscriptions**: Create subscription groups
   - **Grace Period**: Handle payment issues
   - **Account Hold**: Manage subscription pausing

3. **Advanced Settings**:
   - Resubscribe options
   - Cancellation survey
   - Proration settings
   - Tax categories

## Testing Configuration

<Note>
  **Important:** You MUST create and publish your app to a closed testing track
  before you can test in-app purchases or subscriptions on physical Android
  devices. This is a mandatory requirement by Google Play and cannot be skipped.
</Note>

To set up a closed testing track:

1. Navigate to Testing > Closed testing in the Play Console
2. Create a new closed testing release
3. Upload your app bundle/APK
4. Add test users via their Gmail addresses
5. Complete the testing track setup and publish it
6. Wait for Google Play to approve the testing track (usually a few hours)

Only after your closed testing track is approved can you properly test purchases on physical devices. Skipping this step will result in purchase failures. You can find
more information [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/test-and-launch/sandbox/google-play-store).

Testing in-app purchases is crucial before launching. The Play Console provides several testing methods:

1. **License Testing**:

   - Go to Setup > License Testing
   - Add Gmail accounts for testing
   - Enable license testing responses
   - Test purchases will not be charged

2. **Internal Testing Track**:

   - Create an internal testing release
   - Add test users
   - Install app from internal testing track
   - Verify purchase flow

3. **Test Purchase Flow**:
   - Use test accounts to make purchases
   - Verify purchase states
   - Test subscription lifecycle
   - Validate receipt handling

## Best Practices

1. **Product IDs**:

   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Include price in the identifier
   - Make IDs descriptive and unique

2. **Testing**:

   - Test all purchase flows thoroughly
   - Verify cancellation handling
   - Test subscription renewals
   - Validate restore purchases

3. **Documentation**:
   - Keep detailed records of product IDs
   - Document testing procedures
   - Maintain pricing history

## Next Steps

After configuring your products in the Play Console, proceed to:

1. [RevenueCat Dashboard Setup](/react-native-cli/revenueCat-android)
2. [Android Implementation Guide](/react-native-cli/revenueCat-android)

Remember to keep your product IDs handy as you'll need them when setting up your products in RevenueCat.
