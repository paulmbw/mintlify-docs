RevenueCat simplifies in-app purchase and subscription management for iOS applications. Whether you're implementing one-time purchases like premium features or recurring subscriptions for content access, RevenueCat handles the complexity of iOS monetization. Launchtoday comes with RevenueCat pre-integrated, making it easy to start monetizing your app. This guide will walk you through setting up both in-app purchases and subscriptions specifically for your iOS app.

## Overview

RevenueCat provides several key features:

- In-app purchase management
- Subscription analytics and tracking
- Cross-platform receipt validation
- Customer support tools
- Real-time subscription status updates

This guide covers two main types of monetization:
1. **In-app Purchases**: One-time purchases for features or content
2. **Subscriptions**: Recurring revenue through time-based access to content or features

## In-App Purchases

In-app purchases (IAPs) are one-time purchases that unlock specific features or content in your app. There are two main types:

- **Consumable**: Can be purchased multiple times (e.g., virtual currency, game items)
- **Non-consumable**: Purchased once and permanently unlock features (e.g., premium features, ad removal)

### Setting up In-App Purchases

This guide only covers creating consumable items, however the process for non-consumable items is identical.

1. In App Store Connect:

   ```plaintext
   1. Navigate to Your App > Features > In-App Purchases
   2. Click (+) to add a new In-App Purchase
   3. Select "Consumable" or "Non-Consumable"
   4. Configure:
      - Reference Name (internal use)
      - Product ID (e.g., com.yourapp.premium)
      - Price
      - Display Name
      - Description
   5. Add localization if needed
   6. Submit for review
   ```

2. In RevenueCat Dashboard:
   ```plaintext
   1. Go to "Products"
   2. Add New Product
   3. Select "In-App Purchase"
   4. Enter the same Product ID used in App Store Connect
   5. Configure display properties
   ```

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are recurring revenue products that give users access to content or features for a specific duration. Types include:

- **Auto-renewable**: Automatically renews until cancelled
- **Non-renewing**: Fixed duration without automatic renewal

### Setting up Subscriptions

1. In App Store Connect:

   ```plaintext
   1. Navigate to Your App > Features > In-App Purchases
   2. Click (+) to add a new In-App Purchase
   3. Select "Auto-Renewable Subscription"
   4. Configure:
      - Subscription Group
      - Reference Name
      - Product ID (e.g., com.yourapp.pro.monthly)
      - Subscription Duration
      - Price
      - Display Name
      - Description
   5. Set up:
      - Subscription Duration
      - Free Trial (optional)
      - Billing Grace Period
      - Price Points
   6. Add localization
   7. Submit for review
   ```

2. In RevenueCat Dashboard:
   ```plaintext
   1. Go to "Products"
   2. Add New Product
   3. Select "Subscription"
   4. Enter the same Product ID used in App Store Connect
   5. Configure:
      - Display Properties
      - Subscription Period
      - Trial Period (if applicable)
   ```

### Subscription Groups

Subscription groups help organize related subscriptions (e.g., monthly/yearly plans):

```plaintext
Example Structure:
- Pro Subscription Group
  ├─ Monthly Plan (com.yourapp.pro.monthly)
  ├─ Quarterly Plan (com.yourapp.pro.quarterly)
  └─ Annual Plan (com.yourapp.pro.yearly)
```

<Note>
  Users can only have one active subscription within a subscription group. This
  prevents users from purchasing multiple tiers of the same feature set.
</Note>

## Testing Purchases

1. Create Sandbox Testers:

   ```plaintext
   1. App Store Connect > Users and Access > Sandbox
   2. Add Sandbox Tester
   3. Use this account on your test device
   ```

2. Test Purchase Flow:
   ```typescript
   // Example purchase flow
   try {
     const offerings = await Purchases.getOfferings();
     if (offerings.current !== null) {
       const purchase = await Purchases.purchasePackage(
         offerings.current.monthly
       );
       // Handle successful purchase
     }
   } catch (e) {
     // Handle error
   }
   ```
