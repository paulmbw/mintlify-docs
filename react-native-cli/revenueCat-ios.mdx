## Prerequisites

Before integrating RevenueCat for iOS, ensure you have:

- An [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) account with access to your app
- A [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) account (sign up if you haven't already)
- Created and configured your in-app purchases and subscriptions in App Store Connect
  - Products must be properly set up and in "Ready to Submit" state
  - Subscription groups configured (if using subscriptions)
  - Pricing and availability defined
- Your app's bundle identifier matches in both App Store Connect and RevenueCat

To begin, create a new app in RevenueCat and select App Store:

<img
  src="/images/revenue-cat/revenue-cat-1.jpg"
  alt="OAuth Credentials"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>


<img
  src="/images/revenue-cat/revenue-cat-2.jpg"
  alt="OAuth Credentials"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>

Setup your new App Store app. You'll need to specify the bundle ID of your app:

<img
  src="/images/revenue-cat/revenue-cat-3.jpg"
  alt="OAuth Credentials"
  style={{
    borderRadius: "10px",
    maxHeight: "450px",
  }}
/>
