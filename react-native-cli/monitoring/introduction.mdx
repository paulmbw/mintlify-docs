## Overview

Crash reporting and application monitoring are essential components of any production-ready mobile application. They help you maintain app stability, improve user experience, and quickly resolve issues before they impact your users.

## Why It's Important

### 1. Proactive Issue Detection
- Identify crashes and errors in real-time
- Spot performance bottlenecks before users complain
- Monitor app stability across different devices and OS versions

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- Reduce crash rates and app freezes
- Improve app performance
- Maintain high app store ratings

### 3. Efficient Development
- Get detailed stack traces and error contexts
- Reproduce issues with session replay
- Track release adoption and stability

### 4. Business Impact
- Minimize user churn due to technical issues
- Reduce time to resolution for critical bugs
- Make data-driven decisions for app improvements
