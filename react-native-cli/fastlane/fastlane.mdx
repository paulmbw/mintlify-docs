# Fastlane Configuration Documentation

This document explains the Fastlane configuration file (Fastfile) which automates the iOS and Android app deployment process.

## Global Configuration

### Before All Hook
```ruby
before_all do
  ENV["FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_ID"] = "126414293"
  ENV["FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_NAME"] = "Paul Waweru"
  ENV["FASTLANE_APP_IDENTIFIER"] = "com.launchtoday"
  ENV["FASTLANE_USER"] = "paul.waweru58@gmail.com"
```
This section sets up global environment variables that Fastlane will use throughout the deployment process. It includes:
- App Store Connect Team identification
- Team name
- App bundle identifier
- Developer account email

### Environment Management
The configuration includes environment handling for both CI and local builds:
- On CI systems: Uses environment variables set by the CI system
- Local builds: Copies `.env.production` to `.env`

## iOS Platform Configuration

### Build iOS Release Lane
```ruby
lane :build_ios_release do
  increment_build_number(
    build_number: latest_testflight_build_number + 1,
    xcodeproj: "ios/Launchtoday.xcodeproj"
  )
  
  build_ios_app(
    scheme: "Launchtoday",
    workspace: "ios/Launchtoday.xcworkspace",
    configuration: "Release",
    clean: true,
    export_method: "app-store"
  )
end
```
This lane:
1. Automatically increments the build number based on the latest TestFlight version
2. Builds the iOS app in release configuration
3. Prepares it for App Store distribution

### Deploy to TestFlight Lane
```ruby
lane :deploy_testflight do
```
This lane:
1. Reads API credentials from `AppStoreConnect.json`
2. Sets up App Store Connect authentication
3. Triggers the build process
4. Uploads the build to TestFlight

## Android Platform Configuration

### Build Android Release Lane
```ruby
lane :build_android_release do
```
This lane:
1. Increments the version code in the gradle file
2. Cleans and builds a release bundle (`.aab`)
3. Signs the bundle using keystore credentials from environment variables:
   - `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE`
   - `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
   - `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
   - `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

### Deploy to Play Store Lane
```ruby
lane :deploy_playstore do
```
This lane:
1. Triggers the Android release build
2. Uploads the `.aab` file to the Play Store's internal testing track

## Usage

### iOS Deployment
```bash
fastlane ios deploy_testflight
```

### Android Deployment
```bash
fastlane android deploy_playstore
```

## Required Environment Variables

### iOS
- `FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_ID`
- `FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_NAME`
- `FASTLANE_APP_IDENTIFIER`
- `FASTLANE_USER`

### Android
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

## Important Notes
- The configuration supports both CI and local development environments
- API keys and credentials should be properly secured and not committed to version control
- iOS builds require App Store Connect API credentials in `AppStoreConnect.json`
- Android builds require a valid keystore and associated credentials
- Both platforms use automated version/build number incrementing
