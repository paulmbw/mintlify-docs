## Development

### How do I update to the latest version?

If you forked the repository (recommended approach):

1. Add the original repo as upstream: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli.git`
2. Fetch updates: `git fetch upstream`
3. Merge updates: `git merge upstream/main`

### How do I add custom fonts?

1. Add your font files to the `assets/fonts` directory
2. Link the fonts using `react-native.config.js`
3. Run `npx react-native-asset`
4. Rebuild your app

### How do I target a specific iOS simulator?

To run your app on a specific iOS simulator:

1. List available simulators:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices
```

2. Find your desired device from the list, for example:

```bash
iPhone 15 Plus (D7EDC638-041C-4C07-ADB3-FFB558A3C1E4) (Shutdown)
iPhone 15 Pro Max (CBAD5E32-15B8-47B4-9F6B-66C8E84145CE) (Shutdown)
```

3. Boot the specific simulator using its UUID:

```bash
xcrun simctl boot CBAD5E32-15B8-47B4-9F6B-66C8E84145CE
```

4. Update your `package.json` script to target the specific simulator:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ios:simulator": "yarn ios --simulator='iPhone 15 Pro Max'"
  }
}
```

5. Run your app using the updated script:

```bash
yarn ios:simulator
```

<Note>
  Make sure to replace the simulator name with the exact name of your chosen
  device from the `xcrun simctl list devices` output.
</Note>

## Authentication

### Which authentication methods are supported?

- Email/Password
- Magic Link (passwordless)

### How do I customize the authentication flow?

You can customize the authentication flow by modifying the components in `src/screens/auth/`. The authentication logic is handled by Supabase and can be customized in `src/services/auth.ts`.

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open the SQL editor
3. Write and execute your SQL commands
4. Update your TypeScript types in `src/types/supabase.ts`
