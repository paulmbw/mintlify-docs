Launchtoday provides a centralized authentication system through a React Context provider which you can find [here](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/main/src/providers/Auth.tsx). This context manages all authentication flows, user sessions, and authentication state throughout your application.
You can find an example of consuming the auth context in the login screen implementation [here](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-rncli/blob/main/src/screens/Auth/Login/index.tsx).

## Auth Context Provider

The authentication context is implemented using React's Context API and provides a comprehensive set of methods and state for handling user authentication. The provider is already configured in your application's root component, making authentication services available throughout your app.

### Available Methods

The context exposes several authentication methods:

```typescript
// Sign in methods
signInWithApple(): Promise<void>    // Handles Apple authentication flow
signInWithGoogle(): Promise<void>   // Handles Google OAuth flow
signInWithEmail(email: string): Promise<void>  // Initiates Magic Link authentication

// Session management
signOut(): Promise<void>            // Signs out the current user
deleteAccount(): Promise<void>      // Deletes the user's account

// State management
user: User | null                   // Current user information
loading: boolean                    // Authentication loading state
```

## Authentication Flows

### Apple Sign In

The `signInWithApple` method handles the complete Apple authentication flow:

- Requests user consent through Apple's native UI
- Manages identity tokens and nonce validation
- Creates or updates the user profile in Supabase
- Establishes the authenticated session

### Google Sign In

The `signInWithGoogle` method manages OAuth authentication:

- Initiates the OAuth flow through a browser
- Handles redirect and token management
- Processes the authentication response
- Creates or updates the user profile

### Magic Link Authentication

The `signInWithEmail` method implements passwordless authentication:

- Sends a magic link to the provided email
- Handles email redirect
- Establishes the authenticated session

## Session Management

The Auth Context automatically manages user sessions:

- Persists authentication state
- Handles token refresh
- Manages session expiration
- Synchronizes state across the app

## Error Handling

The authentication methods include comprehensive error handling:

- User cancellation handling
- Network error management
- Invalid token handling
- Session expiration handling

## Next Steps

With the authentication context in place, you can implement specific authentication providers:

- [Sign in with Apple](/supabase/apple-signin)
- [Sign in with Google](/supabase/google-signin)
- [Magic Link Authentication](/supabase/magic-links)
