## API Configuration

Launchtoday comes with a backend service that your mobile app will make API requests to. The service provides secure endpoints for payment processing through Stripe, with planned expansion for push notifications and other features.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you should be familiar with:

- **TypeScript**: The backend services are written in TypeScript
- **Koa**: Used as the web framework for building backend services
- **Docker**: Required for containerizing the application
- **fly.io**: Used for deploying and hosting the backend services

## Repository Setup

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/launchtodayhq/launchtoday-backend your-app

# Navigate to project directory
cd your-app

# Set the node version specified in the .nvmrc file
nvm use

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

<Info>
  The project contains a `.nvmrc` file which specifies Node.js version 18.18.2.
  You can either: - Use this version by running `nvm use` to automatically
  switch to 18.18.2 - Or modify the `.nvmrc` file to use your preferred Node.js
  version (must be ≥18.18.2)
</Info>

Make sure you also have Yarn installed on your system before running these commands.

### Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file to create your `.env` using the following command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```
PORT=3000
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key

# Supabase
SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_API_KEY=your_supabase_api_key
```

Don't worry about the Stripe and Supabase keys for now, we'll get to them later in the [Stripe Setup](/react-native-cli/stripe) and [Supabase Setup](/react-native-cli/supabase/setup) sections.

### Running the API Service

Once you have the repository setup and the environment variables set up, you can start the API service using the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your terminal should output something like this:

```bash
➜  yarn dev
yarn run v1.22.19
$ nodemon
[nodemon] 3.1.7
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): src/**/*
[nodemon] watching extensions: ts,js
[nodemon] starting `ts-node ./src/server.ts`

2024-11-11T08:20:40.482Z INFO  Server running on http://0.0.0.0:3000 ✨
  port: 3000
  host: 0.0.0.0
```

You can verify that the API service is running by navigating to `http://0.0.0.0:3000/hello` in your web browser. You should see a JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, world!"
}
```

You can also run the following curl command to verify that the API service is running:

```bash
curl http://0.0.0.0:3000/hello
```

## Deploying the API Service

As previously mentioned, the API service is deployed to [fly.io](https://fly.io). There are several other alternatives to fly.io, but for now we'll focus on deploying with fly.io. Ensure you have a
fly.io account and are logged in before proceeding. You can run the following command to deploy the API service:

1. Run `fly auth signup` if you don't have an account
2. Run `fly auth login` to login to your fly.io account
3. Run `fly launch` to launch the API service

After making API changes, you can deploy the changes by running `fly deploy`.
